# Project
This is a simple **typing game** which is all about typing as much words as you can in 60s.

### How to Play
You should provide an username to register and be able to play the game.
Then you can start playing by clicking play from the menu or if you've just registered,
you will be redirected to game page in *3s*.

## Important to Note
There is a registration phase but **there is not a login functionality** in this application. So when you register with a username, you can't use it anymore after you log out.
I wanted the leaderboard to have as much record as it can, and since *every user could have only 1 record(the best one)* at the leaderboard, i decided that it would be funnier like this.
